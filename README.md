# Machine conditions monitoring

- Type of challenge: Learning
- Duration: `2 weeks`
- Deadline : `02/04/2021 09:00 AM`
- Team challenge: Group project

## Mission objectives

- Be able to work and process data from audio format
- Find insights from data, build hypothesis and define conclusions
- Build machine learning models for predictive classification and/or regression
- Select the right performance metrics for your model
- Evaluate the distribution of datapoints and evaluate its influence in the model
- Be able to identify underfitting or overfitting that might exist on the model
- Tuning parameters of the model for better performance
- Select the model with better performance and following your
  customer's requirements
- Define the strengths and limitations of the model


## The Mission

Acme Corporation is a worldwide supplier of technological equipment. The factory is facing significant problems with their manufacturing line, the machines are constantly facing failures due to a lack of maintenance and the production is stopped every time an unexpected failure is presented. As a result, Acme is losing millions of U.S Dollars and important clients like Wile E. Coyote are experiencing delays in deliveries. 

The company has collected audio samples of equipment working on normal and anomalous conditions. Their objective is to develop a machine learning model able to monitor the operations and identify anomalies in the sound pattern.

The implementation of this model can allow Acme to operate the manufacturing equipment at full capacity and detect signs of failure before the damage is so critical that the production line has to be stopped.

Your mission is to build a machine learning model for Acme so they can continue their manufacturing activities.

### Must-have features

- Explanatory graphics of insights found in data
- Implementation of machine learning models according with the client's requirements
- The performance metrics of the model must be clearly defined.
- Evaluation of the model's performance and definition of its limitations
